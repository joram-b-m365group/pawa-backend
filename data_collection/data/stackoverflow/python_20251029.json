Here are some common problems when the guard is omitted from a script:\n\nIf you import the guardless script in another script (e.g. import my_script_without_a_name_eq_main_guard), then the latter script will trigger the former to run at import time and using the second script's command line arguments. This is almost always a mistake.\n\nIf you have a custom class in the guardless script and save it to a pickle file, then unpickling it in another script will trigger an import of the guardless script, with the same problems outlined in the previous bullet.\n\n\nLong Answer\nTo better understand why and how this matters, we need to take a step back to understand how Python initializes scripts and how this interacts with its module import mechanism.\nWhenever the Python interpreter reads a source file, it does two things:\n\nit sets a few special variables like __name__, and then\n",

A class is an instance of a metaclass.\n\nWhile in Python you can use arbitrary callables for metaclasses (like Jerub shows), the better approach is to make it an actual class itself. type is the usual metaclass in Python. type is itself a class, and it is its own type. You won't be able to recreate something like type purely in Python, but Python cheats a little. To create your own metaclass in Python you really just want to subclass type.\n\nA metaclass is most commonly used as a class-factory. When you create an object by calling the class, Python creates a new class (when it executes the 'class' statement) by calling the metaclass. Combined with the normal __init__ and __new__ methods, metaclasses therefore allow you to do 'extra things' when creating a class, like registering the new class with some registry or replace the class with",

    "prompt": "How can I iterate over rows in a Pandas DataFrame?\n\nI have a pandas dataframe, df:\n   c1   c2\n0  10  100\n1  11  110\n2  12  120\n\nHow do I iterate over the rows of this dataframe? For every row, I want to access its elements (values in cells) by the name of the columns. For example:\nfor row in df.rows:\n    print(row['c1'], row['c2'])\n\n\nI found a similar question, which suggests using either of these:\n\n\nfor date, row in df.T.iteritems():\n\n\n\nfor row in df.iterrows():\n\n\n\nBut I do not understand what the row object is and how I can work with it.",
    "response": "DataFrame.iterrows is a generator which yields both the index and row (as a Series):\nimport pandas as pd\n\ndf = pd.DataFrame({'c1': [10, 11, 12], 'c2': [100, 110, 120]})\ndf = df.reset_index()  # make sure indexes pair with number of rows\n\nfor index, row in df.iterrows():\n    print(row['c1'], row['c2'])\n\n\n10 100\n11 110\n12 120\n\n\nObligatory disclaimer from the documentation\n\nIterating through pandas objects is generally slow. In many cases, iterating manually over the rows is not needed and can be avoided with one of the following approaches:\n\nLook for a vectorized solution: many operations can be performed using built-in methods or NumPy functions, (boolean) indexing, …\nWhen you have a function that cannot work on the full DataFrame/Series at once, it is better to use apply() instead of iterating over the values. See the docs on function application.\nIf you need to do iterative manipulations on the values but performance is important, consider writing the inner loop with cython or numba. ",

Just knowing what directory a file is in does not determine what package Python thinks it is in.  That depends, additionally, on how you load the file into Python (by running or by importing).\nThere are two ways to load a Python file: as the top-level script, or as a\nmodule.  A file is loaded as the top-level script if you execute it directly, for instance by typing python myfile.py on the command line.  It is loaded as a module when an import statement is encountered inside some other file.  There can only be one top-level script at a time; the top-level script is the Python file you ran to start things off.\nNaming\nWhen a file is loaded, it is given a name (which is stored in its __name__ attribute).  If it was loaded as the top-level script, its name is __main__.  If it was loaded as a module, its name is t",

This does the same as the ternary operator ?: that exists in other languages. For example:\nvalue = 123\nprint(value, 'is', 'even' if value % 2 == 0 else 'odd')",

    "response": "Python 3\nIn Python 3, this question doesn't apply. The plain int type is unbounded.\nHowever, you might actually be looking for information about the current interpreter's word size, which will be the same as the machine's word size in most cases. That information is still available in Python 3 as sys.maxsize, which is the maximum value representable by a signed word. Equivalently, it's the size of the largest possible list or in-memory sequence.\nGenerally, the maximum value representable by an unsigned word will be sys.maxsize * 2 + 1, and the number of bits in a word will be math.log2(sys.maxsize * 2 + 2). See this answer for more information.\nPython 2\nIn Python 2, the maximum value for plain int values is available as sys.maxint:\n>>> sys.maxint  # on my system, 2**63-1\n9223372036854775807\n\nYou can calculate the minimum value with -sys.maxint - 1 as shown in the docs.\nPython seamlessly switches from plain to long integers once you exceed this value.
